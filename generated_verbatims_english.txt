However, the post-hospital follow-up by email or phone was lacking, and I did not need re-hospitalization.  Additional charges and excess fees were a significant issue.

Reassurance of children and parents during hospitalization or surgery was lacking.  The medical and paramedical care I received was of varying quality. The emergency response was timely, but the in-hospital emergency response speed was slow. The decision-making between tests was quick, but there were breaches of medical confidentiality. The qualifications and competence of professionals were good, but there was a lack of patient monitoring. Healthcare-associated infections were a concern, and there were unexpected medical or surgical complications. Rehabilitation was insufficient, and assistance with meals, hygiene, and daily activities was often refused.  My patient rights were generally respected, but there were some issues. I had freedom to move around-the-clock availability was lacking.       I did not experience any significant issues with pain management and medications. The side effects of treatments were well-managed, and I was informed about potential side effects. The pain management was effective, and I did not experience any issues with pain management.

The conditions and timing of discharge were satisfactory, and the transport by ambulance was arranged promptly. The availability of beds in follow-up care facilities was ensured, and there was contact with community healthcare providers. The discharge was anticipated and planned well.  The follow-up after my hospital stay was adequate. I received a post-op follow-up call the day after outpatient surgery, and I was able to manage some administrative matters online.

The meals were okay, but the variety was limited, and the timing of snacks was not always convenient.  Overall, while the medical care was good, the personal touch and coordination between services need improvement.

It was a challenging experience overall, but there were a few bright spots. The process of getting appointments was surprisingly efficient, which was a relief. However, the rest of my experience was quite frustrating.  The care pathway was far from smooth. There were constant delays, and the lack of coordination between the different teams made things even more chaotic. The operating room scheduling was a nightmare—there were issues that led to unnecessary waiting and confusion. The movement within the facility wasn't adapted to my condition, and I often felt rushed or ignored. The staff seemed overwhelmed, and it showed in their interactions with patients. They were often rude and dismissive, which made an already difficult situation even harder. There was a complete lack of empathy and support, which was disappointing.  The administrative procedures were a hassle. The forms were numerous and repetitive, and the processes were incredibly complex. The digital tools they had were hardly helpful, and I felt like I was constantly filling out the same information. There were even administrative errors related to my name, which caused more delays and confusion.  The waiting times within the facility were unbearable. The healthcare professionals were rarely punctual, and when they were, they didn't seem to have much time to spare. I couldn't get any meaningful interactions during these waiting periods, and the seating was uncomfortable. The lack of access to entertainment or digital distractions made the wait even more tedious.  The discharge process was rushed and poorly planned. I didn't receive comprehensive information for returning home, and the waiting time to get my surgical report was unnecessarily long. The conditions and timing of my discharge felt hurried, and there was little anticipation or planning involved. The staff seemed more interested in getting me out the door than ensuring I was properly cared for.  One positive note was the consideration and involvement of my caregivers and companions in the care process. They were treated with respect and given the information they needed to support me. Additionally, the individualized support for children was evident, which was heartening to see. However, these positive aspects were overshadowed by the overall negative experience.  The facility itself was in poor condition. The rooms were dirty and the equipment was old and poorly maintained. The noise level was high, with constant disruptions from staff and other patients. The temperature in the rooms was uncomfortable, and the air conditioning made it even worse. The meals were bland and unappetizing, and the timing was inconsistent. The WiFi and TV services were unreliable, adding to the overall frustration.  In summary, while there were a few positive aspects, my stay at the hospital was largely negative. The lack of smoothness and personalization in the care pathway, the administrative hassles, the long waiting times, and the poor conditions of the facility made for a difficult experience. I hope future patients have a better time than I did.

The conditions and timing of discharge were well-planned, and transport by ambulance was arranged. However, there was a lack of beds in follow-up care facilities, and contact with community healthcare providers was limited.  **Follow-up after hospital stay** was adequate. I received a post-op follow-up call the day after outpatient surgery, and I could manage some administrative matters online. However, there was no post-hospital follow-up by email or phone, and I did not need re-hospitalization.  **Additional charges and excess fees** were not an issue.

The staff acknowledged the difficult working conditions, and I had the opportunity to see the attending physician and surgeon post-op. However, there was a lack of time due to staff shortages, and there was no designated doctor in charge. The blaming attitude from staff was noticeable, but the rough handling or lack of consent before OB/GYN procedures was not an issue. The team's listening skills during pediatric care were good. I received clear information about side effects, and my medication allergies and intolerances were considered. The pain management was effective, and the wait times were reasonable. The medication dispensing procedures were straightforward.  **Maternity and pediatrics** were good. I received basic care advice, and breastfeeding support was available.

The emotional support provided was helpful, but the lack of listening and empathy from some staff members was disappointing.  Medical and paramedical care was of high quality.

However, there were some issues with the speed of the emergency response and the need for repeat surgery due to complications.  Patient rights were mostly respected. I had the freedom to move around and was treated with dignity. However, there were some instances of discrimination and a lack of disclosure of harm caused by care.  Pain management and medications were well-handled. The staff considered my medication allergies and intolerances, and the pain management during and after surgery was effective. However, there were some wait times in the pain treatment context that were longer than expected.  Maternity and pediatrics services were not applicable to my stay, so I have no comments on that.

The room temperature was comfortable, with good thermal insulation and heating adapted to the room temperature. However, the noise from roommates and air conditioning was distracting.  Meals and snacks were of good quality. The food was tasty and adapted to my dietary needs. However, the meal and snack timing could have been more consistent.
