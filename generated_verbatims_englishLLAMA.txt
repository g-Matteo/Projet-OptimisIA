The reception and admission process was very smooth and the staff were friendly, which made a great first impression. The administrative procedures were also well-organized and efficient.   However, I was not impressed with the speed of care and waiting time. There were long delays and I often had to wait for what felt like hours to see a doctor.

The discharge process was handled well, and I received comprehensive information about my aftercare. The follow-up care has also been good, with regular check-ins from the hospital staff.   On the other hand, I was disappointed with the medical and paramedical care I received. There were some issues with my treatment plan, and I felt that the doctors could have been more competent.

The reception and admission process was straightforward, and the staff were neither particularly friendly nor unfriendly - they just did their job.   The care pathway was generally well-organized, and I was happy with the personalization of my care. The medical team took my specific needs and preferences into account, which I appreciated.

The speed of care was somewhat slow at times, and I had to wait a while to receive my surgical report after discharge. On the other hand, the discharge process itself was relatively smooth, and I received clear instructions on how to care for myself at home.  One thing that did annoy me was the lack of information and explanations provided by some of the medical staff. I often had to ask multiple times for clarification on my treatment and prognosis. Additionally, I was not impressed with the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the rooms, which could be improved.  The hospital's premises and rooms were generally well-maintained, but I did experience some issues with the shower in my room. The WiFi and TV services were available, but the quality was just average.  Overall, my stay was decent, but there were some areas that could be improved upon. The humanity and availability of the professionals were a highlight, and I appreciated the kindness and compassion shown by some of the staff.
